# Processing-Process-in-Microprocessor-According-to-Priority-and-Communication-Between-Four-Language

This project consists four parts. 

-	FIRST PART ( C ) ;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I build an algorithm that will take processes from text file according to arrival time and that will calculate priority using a quantum 
number (determined maximum time per process) then will add into Binomial Heap. Finally, it will handle processes and will calculate 
average waiting time per process.

-	 SECOND-MAIN PART ( Java );
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I made a Graphical User Interface using JavaFX. The user enters name of input file into text box. This input is sent being parameter to 
“C” program and the “C” program creates some data output files. If the user shows the contents of output files, the JavaFX window offers 
options which are “Is Java?”, “Is Python?” or “Is HTML5?”. The user can choose anything for showing the results.

-	THIRD PART ( Python );
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I made a simple Graphical User Interface in Python for showing the results. When the user chose “Python” in JavaFX window, the python 
program takes name of output file being parameter and shows outputs in the window.

-	 LAST PART ( HTML5-CSS );
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I designed a window using CSS for showing the results. When the user chose “HTML5” in JavaFX window, it is created an “.html” file and 
is run and shown the results automatically.
